# Predicting-customers-which-will-leave-the-bank-using-Artificial-Neural-Netowrks
A classification problem which returns a probability of the customer leaving the bank, thus giving feedbacks about the reason why people are leaving the bank.
This problem is solved using Deep Learning's Artificial Neural network concept.
The neural network is built using the library:- keras.
